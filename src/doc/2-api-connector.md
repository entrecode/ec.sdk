You can view an API connector as the entry point to an [ec.api](https://doc.entrecode.de/en/latest/). Each connector is a class which must be instantiated with `new` and an optional [`environment`](#environment). If no environment is specified the API connector will connect to `live` or rather [production](https://editor.entrecode.de). It is possible to have multiple API connectors for multiple environments.

The two API connectors [Core](#Core) and [Session](#Session) are special cases. Core is the API connector every other inherits from and contains functionality shared by all other API connectors. Session is only used for login and logout. This will allow you to implement tree shaking into your build and only the parts which are used will be in your bundle.
